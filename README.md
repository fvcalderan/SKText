# SKText

Very minimalist and useless GUI text editor. It depends solely on X11.

### Features

None.

### Build

Run `make`.

### Usage

`./SKText [filename]`

if no filename is specified, it defaults to `saved_buffer.txt`.
To save the current buffer, exit the program with `ESC`. Any other
method of exiting leads to the buffer not being saved.
